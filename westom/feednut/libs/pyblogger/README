PyBlogger, v1.3

This is a Python wrapper for Blogger's XML-RPC interface.  For more
information about this interface, see
http://new.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/.

This module works as of this writing, but Blogger has said that their
API may change rapidly, so this wrapper module may be incomplete or
nonworking by the time you read this.
